I created MERN Stack project, that have functionality authentication like login, registration and logout.
Well currently i can not create register.js in client side in this code I create user through POSTMAN using Node JS. after that I can login with client side and access HOME and CART Page. shopping Cart currently working in client side not a dynamic work. but we can increase and decrease items by client side.

If user login then and then other Page access.
